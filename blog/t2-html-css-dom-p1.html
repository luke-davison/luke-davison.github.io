                  <p>For my next task for Dev Bootcamp, I need to discuss what I have learned from the material I have just worked through.  They want me to tell you all about HTML, CSS, DOM and boxes using analogies.  Here goes.</p>
                  <p>HTML is used to define the... <em>things</em> on a webpage.  Hmm, I seem to be off to a bad start here.  One of the videos used the analogy of building a house.  HTML is the archectual plans.  It defines the number of rooms, where the walls go, where the windows go, how the utilities connect etc.  This is HTML's primary purpose - defining what makes up the webpage.</p>
                  <p>CSS is used to provide customisation.  Using the house analogy again, CSS would provide how the rooms are wallpapered, what kind of carpet is used, the plants that are used in the garden.  CSS styles the webpage but specifying small details.  Another aspect of CSS is that it is separate to the HTML so its design elements can be applied to multiple different webpages/houses.  Unfortunately this analogy starts falling down when I say that CSS can be used to move rooms around and if necessary, make them disappeer.  So it's not the best analogy but it's better than anything I could come up with.</p>
                  <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model and refers to how HTML work.  HTML documents are structured trees, in that different aspects branch off from other aspects.  Perhaps we might just leave this explanation at that.  I'm not totally sure of how to define what DOM is so I'll just be confusing people if I continue.</p>
                  <p>Now, boxes!  HTML elements are kind of like boxes - in that they are rectangular and that they are everywhere.  Webpages are made up of rectangular elements and (like boxes) these elements can be put inside other elements/boxes.  Each box consists of the content (stuff inside the box), padding (bubble wrap that keeps the content away from the sides), border (sides of the box) and the margin (how closely the box is stacked next to other boxes).
                  <p>Okay, I get it now.  I see why we are being instructed to write these blog posts.  It helps the content that we're learning sink in if we right it out.  That way I can see my thoughts on the screen.  After all, who else is going to read this blog other than me?</p>
                  <p>And you, whoevever you are.

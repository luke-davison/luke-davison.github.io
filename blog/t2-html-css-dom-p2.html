                  <p>20:50 on 11 March 2017</p>
                  <p>Before I start, I just want to give some praise to the people who have created <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304">these tutorials</a> on HTML and CSS design.  It's rare to see something that professional.  University material and work presentations had nowhere near the quality and interestingness (that's a word, right?) that these ones do.  Check them out if you're interested.</p>
                  <p>I have to write another blog post about HTML and CSS based on what I got out of the Udacity videos on three topics - grid based design, responsive webpages and semantic structure.  It has been a while since I watched them so had to refresh myself on what "grid based design" and "semantic structure" meant (thank you Google).
                  <p>Grid based design is where a webpage is split into twelve vertical columns.  Why twelve? Because it can be divided by one, two, three, four, six, and twelve.  This means that website parts can be easily added to a website depending on what proportion of the screen they are supposed to take up.  For example, a menu taking up a quarter of the screen would span three columns.  The big advantage of this is that these columns can be set up and then used as the basis of whatever website you want to create.
                  <p>Another important feature is the ability for a webpage to be responsive to the size of the screen the viewer is using.  A webpage can be viewed on anything from a small smart phone to a wide screen desktop monitor.  The benefits of making a webpage responsive is that it can look good on any screen size (as long as it is customized correctly) without the developer having to create a different site for the smaller screens.
                  <p>Finally, semantic structure.  This is where I am little less confident in what I know.  Semantic structures are tags in HTML that opperate identically to other tags.  A couple of common ones are "header" and "nav".  The purpose of these tags are to give whoever (or probably more accurately, whatever) is looking at the HTML code an idea about what is in the tag.  My understanding is that this is useful for search engine spiders (or whatever they are called now) that pull information from the webpage as it means they can more reliably pull the actual content information.
                  <p>And just a final note, it has been pointed out that I haven't spell checked by blog entries (yes, I'm talking about you B).  I know I recently keep screwing up words that are two other words combined ("someone", "nowhere" etc).  Just thought I'd let you know that I'll get onto that... soon?
